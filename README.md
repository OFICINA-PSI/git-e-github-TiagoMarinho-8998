## About Me

Hi everyone. I'm a student from a professional school in Portugal called OFICINA, I am currently learning and evolving my programming skills.

My main objective by learning coding is to create games and learn more about the modern tecnology and ways to improve it.

I'm a lonely guy, its very rare for me to work on any kind of team but when I do, I try to be helpfull as much as I can and even see if my co-workers/teammates are ok.
If there's any kind of recommendation, tips or comments directed to by about a code, a job, whatever, I'm all ears.

Game on!
